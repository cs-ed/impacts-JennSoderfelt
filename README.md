# Impacts on Society

The intent of this course will be to include the fundamental structure for the AP Computer Science Principles course, and is aligned with the California Content Standards for Computer Science, grades 6-8. If funding is available through the district, a pre-established curriculum that satisfies the requirements of these programs will be selected. If funding is not available, an in-house curriculum will be developed. This course will include:
* Introduction to basic hardware
* Exploration of data collection and various types of data
* Program/code planning, to include the use of flowcharts
* Basic introduction to algorithms and programming
* Project design, using basic coding components
* Introduction to safety guidelines and protocol development

The impact of computing on society is an incredibly important concept to consider, especially regarding the use of computing by young people. As part of the introductory course, I believe that it is imperative that students learn to critically analyze the impacts of what they are doing in each lesson that they learn. I aim to incorporate this type of analysis throughout the duration of the course, through targeted activities, as well as a routine reflection and analysis for the completion of milestone skills learned. 


## Plan

### Learning Objectives

In addition to the core technological concepts introduced in class, students will have the following opportunities to consider how computing science relates to potential social impacts:
1. Students will be able to define and describe the negative effects of cyberbullying and trolling.
2. Students will identify ways that technology is or could be more accessible and inclusive.
3. Students will evaluate ways that the technology concepts in class are beneficial, and will identify potentially harmful effects from each project.

### Learning Activities

Describe the learning activities and how they will be incorporated into the class. For example, will they include class discussion, written reports, homework, or exams? Will the activity be a one-time lesson or used multiple times in class?
#### Introductory Activities
As part of the introduction to the course, students will be introduced to the following terms: cyberbullying, trolling, accessibility, diversity, equity and inclusion.
Students will be asked to define these terms. Students will be led through several activies through the "Common Sense Media" website: https://www.commonsense.org/education/articles/teach-middle-schoolers-about-social-media-with-fun-online-sim

#### Ongoing Activities
Throughout the duration of the course, students will be asked to evaluate each activity upon its conclusion, as a form of an "exit ticket". At the end of an activity, students will be given a form to complete that asks them to identify potentially harmful effects of that activity, as well as identify ways in which the activity was accessible and inclusive. Students will also be given an opportunity to identify ways in which the activity could be made less harmful and more inclusive (if applicable). Students will also participate in classroom discussions that include articles and current events that are applicable to what we are learning in class at that moment.

### Assessment

As part of the intoroductory activities, students will be given a quiz to ensure their understanding of the key terms (cyberbullying, trolling, accessibility,diversity, equity and inclusion) as they apply to computer science. Periodically, students will be given age appropriate articles or shown videos that address some of the computing science activities that we are currently covering in class. Through the lens of social impact, the articles and/or video clips will serve as a topic of classroom discussion to keep the idea of social impacts in mind. These discussions will serve as a form of informal assessment, to ensure that students have a basic understanding of the concept. Additionally, the activity evaluation ("exit ticket") will serve as a form of assessment to evaluate the student's basic understanding and synthesis of the activity. 

### Outcomes

Through the introduction of diversity, equity, and inclusion in our introductory activities, students will be exposed to the importance of these concepts and how they apply (and are very much intwined) with computer science. The ultimate goal for the culmination of all the activities in this course is that students are able to think critically about what they are doing, and to ensure that their work is as inclusive and accessible as possible. The hope is that students will be able to continue their evaluation of computer science through the social impact lens long after they exit the course. Middle school students often are learning to synthesize what they are learning and apply it to future endeavors. Through the continued practice and repetion of evaluation, the goal is for this process to become more natural for them as they continue through their computing journey.
