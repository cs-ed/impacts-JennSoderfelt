# Impacts on Society

The intent of this course will be to include the fundamental structure for the AP Computer Science Principles course, and is aligned with the California Content Standards for Computer Science, grades 6-8. If funding is available through the district, a pre-established curriculum that satisfies the requirements of these programs will be selected. If funding is not available, an in-house curriculum will be developed. This course will include:
* Introduction to basic hardware
* Exploration of data collection and various types of data
* Program/code planning, to include the use of flowcharts
* Basic introduction to algorithms and programming
* Project design, using basic coding components
* Introduction to safety guidelines and protocol development

The impact of computing on society is an incredibly important concept to consider, especially regarding the use of computing by young people. As part of the introductory course, I believe that it is imperative that students learn to critically analyze the impacts of what they are doing in each lesson that they learn. I aim to incorporate this type of analysis throughout the duration of the course, through targeted activities, as well as a routine reflection and analysis for the completion of milestone skills learned. 


## Plan

### Learning Objectives

Describe the learning objectives for the class that relate to social impacts. Consider using Bloom's Taxonomy to identify the types of cognitive and/or affective outcomes (and their associated verbs): https://bloomstaxonomy.net/

### Learning Activities

Describe the learning activities and how they will be incorporated into the class. For example, will they include class discussion, written reports, homework, or exams? Will the activity be a one-time lesson or used multiple times in class?

### Assessment

Describe how you plan to assess the learning objectives described above.

### Outcomes

Describe how your plan will facilitate diversity/equity/inclusion and help broadening participation in computing. Also describe how the course plan will help long-term goals in addressing computing impacts on society.
